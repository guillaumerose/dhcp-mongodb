MongoDB module for DHCP (lastest version)
This is just a simple hack in order to use MongoDB as user database
(instead of LDAP).

Warning : works only for statements for a given host.

Install :

* Modify server/passerelle.c to match your configuration
* Build as usual 
	* ./configure
	* make
	* make install
* Edit dhcpd.conf
* Run dhcpd
	
Model :

DHCP will search in your collection in your db (specified in passerelle.c)
an entry like this :

{ "mac" : "user's mac", "dhcp" : "fixed-address 192.168.0.2;" }

If nothing is returned, DHCP will use dhcpd.conf

Incomming :

This patch permits to configure easily DHCP (think about MongoDB model
in Ruby On Rails), to scale, and a lot more.

(Radius and Bind comming soon)
